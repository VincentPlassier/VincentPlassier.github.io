I began a research engineer position at [Huawei Technologies](https://www.huawei.com/fr/) in the [Lagrange Center](https://www.huawei.com/fr/news/fr/2020/centre-lagrange) at the end of February 2024, focusing on distilling diffusion models. Prior to this, I successfully defended my PhD in October 2023 at École Polytechnique, within the CMAP laboratory, under a grant from Huawei Technologies. My doctoral research was supervised by [Eric Moulines](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ric_Moulines) and [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I am currently working on federated Monte Carlo methods with applications to large-scale Bayesian inference. More broadly, I am interested in the following topics:
- Machine learning applications
- Distributed/Federated Monte Carlo methods
- Uncertainty quantification via Conformal Prediction/Bayesian Fusion
- Diffusion models

Previously, I graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, where I earned a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. Additionally, I hold a master's degree Mathematics, Vision and Learning, from ENS Paris-Saclay ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

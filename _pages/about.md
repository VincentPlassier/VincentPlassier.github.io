Hello, I am a third year PhD candidate at CMAP (Ecole Polytechnique) and Lagrange research center. My advisors are [Eric Moulines](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ric_Moulines) and [Alain Durmus](https://alain.perso.math.cnrs.fr/).

I am currently working on federated Monte Carlo methods with applications to large-scale Bayesian inference. More broadly, I am interested in the following topics:
- Machine learning applications
- Distributed/Federated Monte Carlo methods
- Uncertainty quantification via Conformal Prediction/Bayesian Fusion

Previously, I graduated from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay. proceeI hold a master's degree in applied mathematics from ENS Paris-Saclay and a master' degree in Mathematics, Vision and Learning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)).

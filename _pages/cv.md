Education
======
* <b>2023-present</b>: Postdoctoral researcher at Ecole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, team SIMPAS, France
* <b>2019-2022</b>: PhD candidate at Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, group S2A, IDS, France
* <b>2018-2019</b>: MSc in Mathematics,Vision and Learning, Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, France
* <b>2016-2019</b>: MSc in applied mathematics, Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France

Work experience
======
* <b> October - June 2019/2020 <b>: Research internship (UCLouvain)
  * Supervisor : Prof Johan Segers
  * Conducted research on empirical processes and Monte Carlo simulations. Utilized control variates to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimate and ensure convergence guarantees for worst-case prediction risk.
* <b> April - September 2019 <b>: Research internship (Télécom Paris)
  * Supervisor : Prof Florence d’Alché-Buc
  * Conducted research on kernel methods, focusing on the feature map to transfer the data into a Hilbert space. By doing so, the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem is transformed into the solution of a linear problem within this Hilbert space (5.5 months).
* <b> April - July 2018 <b>: Research internship (Université Paul Sabatier)
  * Supervisor : Prof Aurélien Garivier
  * Investigated impact of neural network layer numbers on expressiveness, comparing 2-layer and 3-layer networks (4 months).
* <b> April - June 2017 <b>: Research internship (Research Center for Applied Mathematics)
  * Supervisor : Prof Agnès Desolneux
  * Study of stochastic processes to model the sea surface (2 months).
* <b> April - June 2017: Viva examiner in CPGE (pre-university admission)
  * Conducted oral examinations for MPSI students at Lycée Jacques Decour (Paris IX).

Education
======
* <b> 2020-2023 </b>: PhD Candidate at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, France
* <b> 2019-2020 </b>: Research internship at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium
* <b> 2018-2019 </b>: MSc in Mathematics, Vision, Learning, Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, France
* <b> 2018-2019 </b>: MSc in Applied Mathematics, Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, France

Work experience
======
* <b> February - Present 2024/NA <b>: Research Scientist, Huawei Technologies
  * Started at Huawei as a PhD candidate. Currently, continue to develop conformal prediction techniques to generate robust prediction sets. My new research area includes diffusion models for image generation and acceleration of image sampling.
* <b> October - June 2019/2020 <b>: Research internship, UCLouvain
  * Supervisor : Prof Johan Segers
  * Conducted research on empirical processes and Monte Carlo simulations. Utilized control variates to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimate and ensure convergence guarantees for worst-case prediction risk.
* <b> April - September 2019 <b>: Research internship, Télécom Paris
  * Supervisor : Prof Florence d’Alché-Buc
  * Conducted research on kernel methods, focusing on the feature map to transfer the data into a Hilbert space. By doing so, the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem is transformed into the solution of a linear problem within this Hilbert space (5.5 months).
* <b> April - July 2018 <b>: Research internship, Université Paul Sabatier
  * Supervisor : Prof Aurélien Garivier
  * Investigated impact of neural network layer numbers on expressiveness, comparing 2-layer and 3-layer networks (4 months).
* <b> April - June 2017 <b>: Research internship, Research Center for Applied Mathematics
  * Supervisor : Prof Agnès Desolneux
  * Study of stochastic processes to model the sea surface (2 months).
* <b> April - June 2017 <b>: Viva examiner in CPGE (pre-university admission)
  * Conducted oral examinations for MPSI students at Lycée Jacques Decour (Paris IX).
